# A summary about you
summary:
  My name is Aron Saengchan and I am currently working as a Software Developer at Arcurve Inc. I am a dual graduate at the
  University of Calgary, holding a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering and an M.Eng. in Software Engineering. My prior
  experience includes engineering consulting and academic research through previous internships. My pivot to software was
  ultimately driven by my fascination with technology and I am constantly looking at how I can apply the skills I learn in
  innovative and meaningful ways.
