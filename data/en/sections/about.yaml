# A summary about you
summary:
  My name is Aron Saengchan and I am currently working as a Software Developer at Arcurve. I am a dual graduate at the
  University of Calgary, holding a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and a master's degree in Software Engineering. My prior
  experience includes engineering consulting and academic research through previous internships. My pivot to software was
  ultimately driven by my fascination with technology and I am constantly looking at how I can apply the skills I learn in
  innovative and meaningful ways.
